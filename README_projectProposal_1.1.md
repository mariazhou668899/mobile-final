This project is the final project for Mobile Computing. We will creat a stroy creating and telling platform - PureStory for young generation. 

App Name: LoveStorying

Team members: Maria Zhou, Brenda Sugey Vega Contreras, Pankti Shah

Summary of Project:

This application provides a platform for the young generation (age 3 - 12) to create stories, share stories and discover interesting stories 
from peers, parents, teachers or professional writers. Users can create fiction, nonfiction or educational stories by inputting characters, 
background and genre, and choose the length of stories. The app will then generate a story with illustrations with the help of AI. The goal is to 
help children develop good reading habits, so reading comprehension questions will be added to evaluate if the user has read the story. 
Users will also be able to share their own stories, like and provide feedback for other stories, and even report inappropriate content to ensure a safe online environment.
